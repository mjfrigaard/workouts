## training principles

Focus on these five movements:

  1. A large posterior chain movement (heavy pull: DB-toss, deadlift, etc.)
  2. An upper-body push (seated or standing press)
  3. An upper-body pull (pull-ups, rows, heavy bicep curls, etc.)
  4. A simple full-body explosive move (KB/DB cleans, swings, snatches)
  5. Abs (something with planks, rotation, etc.)

## masters-level training (past age 35) takeaways:

  1. The bad news: the general consensus is that a man’s testosterone level starts to decline by ~1% per year after he passes 30, and muscle tissue is lost at the rate ~of 3%-8% each decade for people who don't perform resistance training
  2. You're getting slower and weaker: Type 2 (fast twitch) muscles starts to decrease faster than Type 1, so power/speed is the first thing to go (which is why it's so important to train)
  3. Get your shit together: The effects of sleep/nutrition/alcohol become more pronounced (it's impossible to 'work off' a bad diet or excess alcohol consumption)
  4. Less is better: To avoid muscle loss, perform multiple-joint exercises supplemented with single-joint exercises that cumulatively address all of the major muscle groups 2 or 3 nonconsecutive days per week
